# Internet Service Provider Mini-Sites

The following serves as an outline for the construction of several pre-designed mini-sites ("The Project"), defines the scope of work to be performed, and serves as an agreement between ________ ("The Consultant") and ________ ("The Client").

---

## 1. Description of Services

The Consultant will take the four finished designs provided by The Client and build them into four finished static websites. Each website contains six pages. The Client will then be responsible for any server-side scripting needed to provide any additional functionality (forms, dynamic content management systems, etc) and for migrating the static website files to their server.

The websites will be built using the latest standards of web design, including HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript where necessary, and will be accessible from all modern web-enabled devices that support modern web standards (IE9, IE8, Safari, Chrome, and Firefox).

They'll be coded in a responsive way that will be able to handle reasonable variations in content without "breaking".

## 2. Website Outline

Each mini-site follows the same structure/page architecture and mostly identical content. Only minor differences in content will be needed, specific to each service provider.

### Pages
